I would like this app to be able to scrape a webpage for documentation on a particular topic so that a student can create flashacards on a particular topic and memorize a topic quickly.  For example, if I may want to scrape the Ruby docs page for the Array class so that I can memorize syntax and class methods.  This was inspired by using the Flashtabs chrome extension and finding limited functionality.
